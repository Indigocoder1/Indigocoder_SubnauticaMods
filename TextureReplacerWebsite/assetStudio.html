    <div>The first thing you want to do is download the latest version of Asset Studio for .net472 from this link:</div>
    <a href="https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio/releases" target="_blank">https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio/releases</a>
    <div>Once you've downloaded it extract the zip and open AssetStudioGUI.exe</div>
    <div>You should now see this:</div>

    <div>Click on File in the top left, and then click load folder.</div>
    <div>Navigate to Subnautica's file location and select the Subnautica_Data folder and click Select Folder in the bottom right.</div>
    <img src="img/assetStudio2.png" width="630" height="353" alt="Screenshot showing the Load Folder prompt from the File tab">
    <div>The import process will now begin. This may take a while, and there is a bar at the bottom of the app to indicate progress</div>
    <div>Once the import process is finished click on the Asset List tab at the top left. Here you can search for any asset in the game.</div>
    <div>To find the "aqua_bird_01" texture search "aqua_bird_01" in the search bar.</div>
    <div>You can also use the filter type dropdown to sort by specific file types.</div>
    <div>Once you find the texture you want right click on it and select "Export selected assets"</div>
    <img src="img/assetStudio3.png" width="630" height="353" alt="Screenshot of Asset Studio showing the aqua_bird_01 texture and the 'Export selected assets' prompt">
    <div>Once you select the export destination you can exit the texture however you want to use in a texture config.</div>
    <div>One thing you have to keep in mind is that you need to put all custom textures in the Assets folder in the mod folder for it to work.</div>
