    <h2 class="bottom-border">Adding custom texture configs</h2>
    <div>To add a new config will need to add a new TextureConfigItem to the TextureConfigList.</div>
    <div>This can be done by editing the Json file in the BepInEx/Configs/TextureReplacer folder, or creating a new Json file.</div>
    <div>If you want to create a new file it's recommended to use Visual Studio or some other code editor to make sure you don't mess up the syntax.</div>
    <div>To generate the config folder you have to run the game first.</div>
    <p>
        To add a new item it will need to be formatted in a specific way.
        Here is an example of an item that could be added to the list:
    </p>    
    <pre>
{
    "<font color=#1988bf>configName</font>": "Example name",
    "<font color=#1988bf>materialIndex</font>": 0,
    "<font color=#1988bf>fileName</font>": "Intentionally blank",
    "<font color=#1988bf>prefabClassID</font>": "Intentionally blank",
    "<font color=#1988bf>rendererHierarchyPath</font>": "Intentionally blank",
    "<font color=#1988bf>textureName</font>": "_MainTex",
    "<font color=#1988bf>isVariation</font>": false,
    "<font color=#1988bf>variationChance</font>": -1.0,
    "<font color=#1988bf>linkedConfigNames</font>": [
      "Example name 1"
    ]
}
    </pre>
    <div class="bottom-border">Explanation of these items:</div>
    <pre>
<font color=#1988bf>configName</font> - This is used in the linkedConfigNames list.
It can be whatever value you want and doesn't need to relate to the texture.

<font color=#1988bf>materialIndex</font> - Relates to the list of materials on the renderer of the prefab you're replacing.
Is uses 0 based indexing, so the first item would be index 0, 2nd would be index 1, etc.

<font color=#1988bf>fileName</font> - The name of the image you're replacing the texture with.
The file will need to be in the Assets folder of the mod, and include the file extension.

<font color=#1988bf>prefabClassID</font> - The classID of the prefab that's the parent of the texture you're trying to replace.
The easiest way to find this is to use the runtime editor by Lee23. On the sidebar you can view the runtime editor tutorial.

<font color=#1988bf>textureName</font> - The name of the texture on the material.
The default texture is "_MainTex" which replaces the albedo texture. To see a list you can go into Unity and right click on a material and click edit shader.

<font color=#1988bf>rendererHierarchyPath</font> - The path to the child containing the renderer for the prefab.
Like the classID this is easiest to find with the runtime editor. As with the classID you can use the runtime editor tutorial.

<font color=#1988bf>isVariation</font> - Use this if you want there to be a chance for your texture to be replaced.
By default all textures are always loaded. This value is only useful if variationChance is greater than 0.

<font color=#1988bf>variationChance</font> - The chance from 0 to 1 that the texture will be loaded.
This is only useful if <font color=#1988bf>isVariation</font> is true

<font color=#1988bf>linkedConfigNames</font> - A list of <font color=#1988bf>configNames</font> that can link 2 variant configs together.
Example: If you have 2 variants, config 1 and config 2, and you want both to be loaded together,
you have to put each other's <font color=#1988bf>configName</font> in the <font color="#1988bf">linkedConfigNames</font> list
    </pre>
<div class="top-border">
    All parts of the config follow Json formatting, so when adding new items to a list you must add a comma at the end of the previous item
</div>
<pre>
An example of this is:

"<font color="#1988bf">linkedConfigNames</font>": [
  "Example name 1", <-- Comma
  "Example name 2"
]

<strong>Or</strong>

{
    *Texture config here*
}, <font color="Red">&lt;--</font> Comma
{
    *Texture config 2 here*
}
</pre>
<h3 class="top-border">Texture Names</h3>
<div>Here are some basic texture names that are commonly used:</div>
<ul>
    <li>_MainTex - The main color of the object. This color is also influenced by the _SpecMap</li>
    <li>_SpecMap - The map that describes how light reflects off an object. This can usually be set to the same texture as _MainTex and gives a more vibrant feel</li>
    <li>_EmissionMap - Affects the luminescence coming off an object. It defaults to 0.6 but can be changed by adding -[my value] to the end of the name. E.g. "_EmissionMap-0.4"</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="top-border"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></h3>
<div>One thing you have to keep in mind when adding the custom texture/image files is that you have to put them inside of the Assets folder in the mod folder.</div>
