# Indogocoder_SubnauticaMods

This is all my mods for Subnautica

Most of them are for BepInEx, but some are for Legacy
They are marked if they have multiple versions
If they are not marked, they are for BepInEx

Permission is given to port Legacy mods that I am no longer maintaining and that do not have a BepInEx version to BepInEx
Permission is also given to port 2.0 mods to Legacy as long as you credit me in the description and link the original mod
